## üîÅ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion & Initial Check
- Load dataset and inspect schema.
- Check for missing values and inconsistent types.
- No missing values found ‚Üí ready for preprocessing.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze distributions of User Behavior Class, Age, Gender, OS.
- Visualize correlations between App Usage Time, Screen On Time, Battery Drain, Data Usage.
- Insights: heavy usage correlates with high battery consumption; Class 2 dominates.

### 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables.
- Standardize numeric variables for ANN modeling.
- Dataset split into 80% training / 20% testing.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Create derived metrics (e.g., usage per app, battery per hour).
- Correlation analysis to select features for ANN.

### 5. ANN Model Training
- Train ANN with training set, validation split 0.33, 100 epochs.
- Monitor accuracy and loss to ensure proper convergence.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate test accuracy and analyze confusion matrix.
- Class 1 shows highest correct-classification rate (73.8%).

### 7. Predictions
- Generate predicted classes for test set.
- Evaluate probability distributions across classes.

### 8. Model Visualization
- Infographic charts for training accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
- Heatmaps and scatterplots for feature correlations.

### 9. Reporting & Business Insights
- Infographic + one-page summary for stakeholders.
- Provides actionable insights for app retention, device optimization, and personalization strategies.

## üí° Conclusions

- Device usage intensity directly impacts battery consumption and app interaction.  
- Behavior Class 2 dominates the population, while Class 1 is least represented.  
- ANN achieved **76.62% accuracy**, showing good predictive performance.  
- Confusion matrix shows Class 1 was most accurately predicted (73.8%).  
- Misclassifications mainly occur between adjacent classes (2 and 3), suggesting overlapping behavioral traits.  
- ANN effectively models nonlinear relationships, supporting segmentation and targeted interventions for different user behavior classes.
