## üéØ Project Objectives
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset for modeling.  
2. Understand patterns and correlations in mobile usage.  
3. Build and train a **Deep Learning model (ANN)** to classify `User Behavior Class`.  
4. Evaluate model performance and interpret patterns.  
5. Visualize findings through an **infographic** for non-technical audiences.

## üß© Model Architecture (ANN)
- **Input Layer:** normalized numeric features  
- **Hidden Layers:** 2‚Äì3 Dense layers (ReLU activation)  
- **Dropout:** to prevent overfitting  
- **Output Layer:** softmax activation (5 classes)  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss:** categorical crossentropy  
- **Metrics:** accuracy, F1-score  

Example summary (Keras):
```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=X_train.shape[1]),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(5, activation='softmax')
])
